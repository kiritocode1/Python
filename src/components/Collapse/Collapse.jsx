        <Text h6 className='mt-2' > This is a simple example of a code written in python . If youre new to programming and this is very difficult to understand ,  <strong className='font-serif text-yellow-400'>Dont worry!</strong>  we will cover all parts of this code in the future where I'll teach it in a way that  these concepts feel natural . For now essentially all this code  is doing is printing <strong className='text-[#fe661f] font-medium '>"hello world"</strong> constantly. <br />
          All im asking you to do is get familliar to how easy to read and write this program is compared to other languages . ðŸ˜Š so beautiful and soo elegant way to express complex thoughts . <br />
          the absense of brackets and other syntax  makes python a great starting language to learn  programming with.

        <Text >
          the main design philosophy in python is to not care about the speed but the Simplicity to write the code  , its almost  <b className="tic-tock my-2">Criminal</b> . Python does not want you to care about the hardware and underlying physical processes like pointers and garbage collection  .
          which im sure if you learn C language , you'll understand is such an amazing feature of the python . <br />
          what do you say ? do you prefer <b>Control</b> over this seemingly important aspect of program or would you prefer let python handle them . 
          <br />
          <b className='flex items-center gap-1 flex-wrap' >Personally I would prefer python's ways coz i just want to turn of my brain <Switch

          and let python handle these stuff ðŸ˜­.
